				<p> Some of my Major Achievements are : </p>
								
				<ul>
				<li> Cracking JEE .. ofcourse even if its an unordered list this has to be at the TOP. </li>
				<li> Have successfully survived on LBS food for a Month now officially. </li>
				<li> Completing this assignment ON TIME which I had not thougth would be possible.  </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p> I have always been one of the mentality to be invloved in all activites I can which has definitely
				    made me a jack of al trades , but unfortunately many a times due to my inadequacy or badluck
					I have failed to master that art . 
					<br>
					All in all I like to play Cricket , Football (especially with friends) , Basketball , 
					Badminton and watch all kinds of sports. I like to innovate in the different things I am taught 
					or get to know , like to have a good sleep and well I like to eat variety of cuisines a lot too .
					Hoping that this new journey is as fruitful and enjoyable as the ones I have successfully completed !
